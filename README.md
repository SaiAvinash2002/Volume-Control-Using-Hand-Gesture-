# Volume-Control-Using-Hand-Gesture

## Problem statement 
‚ÄúHand Gesture Recognition Using
Camera ‚Äù is based on concept of Image
processing. In recent year there is lot of
research on gesture recognition using
kinect sensor on using HD camera but
camera and kinect sensors are more costly.
This paper is focus on reduce cost and
improve robustness of the proposed
system using simple web camera.
## Objectives

## Social Importance
1. It can used for the people who are suffering with Technophobia (simply known as the complexity involved in present tech we are using). It resembles daily life     gestures by which the user interact easily.

2. The Technophiles out there are always interested in different types of ways to interact with the present techonoloy.

3. Incase of any input peripherals malfunction, these gesture controls will come in handy.
